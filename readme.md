fusionpath is simple command line utility that just outputs path to [Fusion 2.5](https://store.steampowered.com/app/248170/Clickteam_Fusion_25/) installation or nothing if error occurs.

Note: This only works with Fusion 2.5 if you have Multimedia Fusion 2 or other older Fusion versions it wont work as they store their installation path in difrent registry keys.
